# Geo-fencing
This project helps to load the map in the window which can be accessed by the farmers in order to see the land under their possession. Also it helps to predict the most suitable crops according to the soil, climate and other features 
Major challenge in the project-usually farmers dont relay on the apps to get an advice. so gaining their trust was a big challenge
